## tl;dr

- Use feature branches, keep `main/master` clean
- Commit small, focused changes often
- Write clear commit messages ([how-to](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/))
- Exclude large files ([.gitignore guide](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore))
- Always add unit tests for new code
- Use pre-commit hooks for formatting & linting

## Repository Organization

- Prefer a single repository for each project, especially if you are working solo. This keeps things simple and avoids confusion.
- Only consider splitting into multiple repositories if you have a large team and clear separation between project parts (e.g., backend vs frontend).
- Source code in `/src`, tests in `/tests`, examples in `/examples`
- Document dependencies in `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`
- Use [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for large files
- Protect `main`/`master` branches ([branch protection](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/using-branch-protection-rules))


## Main Branch & Versioning

- The `main` branch is the single source of truth. All code should be merged here.
- Avoid opening many branches at onceâ€”keep your branch structure simple and focused.
- Use feature branches for specific changes, and delete them after merging.
- Keep your version history clean by using [tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) for releases instead of long-lived branches.

## Daily Workflow

- `git pull` before work, `git push` after
- Delete merged branches
- Tag releases for tracking ([tagging guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging))
- Never force-push shared branches

## Coding Standards & Tooling

- Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for style
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for formatting
- Lint with [pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/) or [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/)
- Use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for hooks
- For notebooks, use [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) and spell checkers
- Interactive scripts: [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) or [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/)
